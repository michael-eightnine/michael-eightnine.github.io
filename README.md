Small repo that contains my current professional website. Built with Vite, React & Typescript.

Features your standard portfolio content, displayed via modular dialog components that mimic old web popup experiences.

Also includes a dungeon crawler text based mini-game, because why not build something fun while I was at it.

### ! Bonus Content !

This repo also includes the `eternal-devotion` SPA as a subdirectory. Eternal Devotion is a small portfolio of watercolor paintings and prose. A spiritual successor to my older Hometown [dis]Advantage projects.
